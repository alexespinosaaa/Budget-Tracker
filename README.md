## Overview

This project is a **personal budgeting/finance tool** built with Python and SQLite.  
It allows users to:

- Track **wallet balances** and **net worth** (by currency).
- Record and undo **expenses**.
- Organize spending with **categories**.
- Define and complete **goals**.
- Generate **analytics and descriptive statistics**.
- Display **net worth by currency** in a PySide6 (Qt) widget.

Designed for individuals who want a simple, extensible tool to manage personal finances while providing developers with a clean backend structure for further customization.

---

## Key Features

- üí∏ **Expenses**
  - Record new expenses with `record_expense`.
  - Undo expenses with `redo_expense`.
  - Summaries by week/month.
  - Descriptive statistics: mean, median, and "mode" by expense name.

- üí∞ **Wallets**
  - Manage multiple wallets with `get_all_wallets` and `order_by`.
  - Transfer between wallets (`transfer_money`).
  - Calculate net worth per currency with `calc_networth(mode=1)`.

- üéØ **Goals**
  - Complete goals via `complete_goal`: deduct from wallet, log as expense, and delete the goal.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Legacy function `ordeBy` remains for backward compatibility.

- üìä **Analytics**
  - Weekly aggregates (`weekly_expenses`).
  - Monthly comparisons (`month_comparasion` ‚ö†Ô∏è typo in function name preserved for compatibility).
  - Descriptive stats (`calc_descriptive_stats_per_month`).

- üñ•Ô∏è **UI**
  - Qt table widget `networth_by_currency_table_qt` showing net worth totals grouped by currency.

## Architecture

The project is structured into layers for clarity and maintainability:

main.py # Entry point for the application
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/ # Qt windows and UI logic
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ... # (multiple files for different windows)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crud/ # Low-level CRUD operations (database I/O)
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wallets.py
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ expenses.py
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ categories.py
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ goals.py
‚îÇ ‚îÇ
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ high_level/ # High-level functions and analytics
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis.py # Graph plotting, analytics
‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reporting.py # Additional high-level utilities

‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ db.py # SQLite connection handler
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ util/ # Configuration and helpers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py

### Flow

1. **`main.py`** starts the program and initializes the UI.  
2. **UI layer** (in `ui/`) manages user interactions and windows.  
3. **High-level layer** (in `backend/high_level/`) provides plotting functions and analytics used by the UI.  
4. **CRUD layer** (in `backend/crud/`) directly interacts with the database (`wallet`, `expense`, `goal`, `category`).  
5. **Database layer** (`backend/db.py`) manages connections to SQLite.  

This layered approach ensures a clean separation of concerns:  
- UI handles presentation.  
- High-level logic handles analytics/graphs.  
- CRUD handles raw database operations.  
- DB handles persistence.  

### Key functions

- **Wallets**: `get_all_wallets`, `get_wallet_by_id`, `order_by`, `transfer_money`, `calc_networth`
- **Expenses**: `add_expense`, `get_all_expenses`, `redo_expense`, `record_expense`, `weekly_expenses`, `calc_descriptive_stats_per_month`
- **Goals**: `complete_goal`, `ordeBy`
- **UI**: `networth_by_currency_table_qt`

## Data & Database

The project uses **SQLite** as its backend. The schema is defined in [`schema.sql`](schema.sql)-

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.11+**
- SQLite (bundled with Python stdlib)
- Virtual environment recommended

### Steps

git clone https://github.com/your-username/budget-tracker.git
cd budget-tracker

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Roadmap

Planned improvements and future features include:

- **Currency Conversion:**  
  Extend `calc_networth(mode=2)` to support automatic conversion between currencies using live exchange rates.  

- **Testing & CI:**  
  Add a test suite (e.g., with `pytest`) and configure continuous integration (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ensure reliability across updates.  

- **AI-Powered Analytics:**  
  Introduce AI/ML features for advanced insights, such as identifying unusual spending patterns, forecasting future expenses, and providing personalized recommendations.  

- **Enhanced UI:**  
  Expand beyond the current Qt table widget to include charts, dashboards, and richer visualizations of financial data.  

## Usage

After installation, run the application with:

python main.py
The main.py file starts the program and initializes the UI.

Common tasks
Record a new expense
from backend.high_level.analysis import record_expense
record_expense(
    name="Lunch",
    cost=12.50,
    date_str="2025-09-15",
    category_id=1,
    wallet_id=2,
    description="Sandwich and coffee"
)

Undo an expense
from backend.high_level.analysis import redo_expense
redo_expense(expense_id=10)
Calculate net worth per currency

from backend.high_level.analysis import calc_networth
print(calc_networth(mode=1))
# Example output: {'EUR': 200.0, 'USD': 150.0}

Display net worth in a Qt widget
from backend.high_level.analysis import networth_by_currency_table_qt
widget = networth_by_currency_table_qt()
widget.show()

## Analytics & Reports

The application includes several functions to analyze financial data:

from backend.high_level.analysis import weekly_expenses
print(weekly_expenses(4))
# Example output: {'2025-W37': 120.50, '2025-W36': 98.20, '2025-W35': 140.00} 
Returns a dictionary of weekly totals for the last n weeks.

from backend.high_level.analysis import month_comparasion
print(month_comparasion())
# Example output: (450.0, 520.0, 70.0)
Compares expenses of the current month with the previous month

from backend.high_level.analysis import calc_descriptive_stats_per_month
print(calc_descriptive_stats_per_month("07-2025"))
# Example output: {'mean': 23.45, 'median': 19.99, 'mode': 'Coffee'}
Provides mean, median, and mode (most repeated expense name) for a given month.

## Building a Windows exe

To distribute the application as a standalone executable, use PyInstaller.

### one file build
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile main.py

### one folder build
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir main.py

Since the project already includes the necessary icon files, make sure to add them when building:
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile main.py \
  --add-data "path/to/icons;icons"

Replace path/to/icons with the correct relative path inside your project.
The ;icons part ensures the files are placed into an icons/ folder alongside the executable.
